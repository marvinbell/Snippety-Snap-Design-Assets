Notes for desktop/mobile website

Disclaimer: I wanted to show off a general idea of the new design before fully commiting to it
Here are some ideas that I had for under each page. Let me know any changes or stuff you want to make
before we go a little further

Portal Page
- for the portal page i image that there could be animation like lights floating in the back
with the red overlay like how I have it in the design

App Page
- this is the page the user will jump to when they click on User? in the portal
- will have an interactive app display of the snippety snap app that will work like that app say
say for the camera function that will ONLY be simulated, not working
- the user will have the option to go back to the portal page

Home Page
- this will be the page the user goes to when they click on Business?
- the page will continuously scroll down
- the navigator bar will follow with the user screen
- any option the user clicks, they will automatically scroll to the corresponding option
- under the "products" seciton, paraphanellia will scroll horizontally (sorta like a photo gallery)
to show of snippety snap items
- clicking the "see more" button would take them to the primary shopping page
- carts will have their own shopping and check out page
